# International Meetings

## International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning
We advise people interested in CBR to check this page and the iccbr.org web site for information on upcoming and past CBR meetings. There have been reports on commercial conference organizations using the brand name ICCBR for for-profit activities. We would like to make clear that conferences not listed here or at iccbr.org are not endorsed by or affiliated with the CBR community.
From 2010, ICCBR and ECCBR have been merged in a single conference series, called ICCBR. As there have been 8 previous ICCBR events and 9 previous ECCBR events, ICCBR 2010 is considered the 18th ICCBR.
